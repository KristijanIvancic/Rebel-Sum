# Welcome to My Mathematical Redemption

I was a shit student.

I loved math as a kid because it made sense. It was easy to succeed. There were rules to follow, and I followed them. Most of it was very intuitive. You could show me a concept, it would click, and I could immediately apply it.

At some point, things stopped clicking. It was subtle. Maybe I didn't catch all of the theory and its implications, but I could still solve most of the problems. But the clicks were becoming sparse, ever so slowly, until there was only silence.

Luckily, you don't need "clicks" to pass standardized tests. Tests are based on solving problems. And problems always have a specific set of steps to reach a solution. As long as I knew the steps, I could stay afloat.

But discomfort, guilt, and shame soon became my regular companions. I wasn't _actually_ doing math anymore, I was just pretending. What used to be positive friction and the joy of overcoming challenges became a thorny part of my brain where I refused to go.

Since math _used to_ come easily to me, I couldn't handle it being a struggle and having to work for my insights. By the time I hit Uni, my work ethic was waaay lower than my peers and I got distracted by the amazing student social life.

I left my math intuition behind and I regret it deeply. I wasted so much time and _potential_! Thankfully, I don't need the University anymore. All the resources I could ever need are available online. And I am determined to redeem myself as a mathematician.

So, I'm going to pretend to go through an undergrad degree in pure math. I want to think like a mathematician. I'll read books, watch courses and solve problems. As I go through this journey, I'm gonna take you along.

If you've ever read [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/), that's the aesthetic I'm aiming for. I wanna be the Tim Urban of math.

## But Why, You Nerd?

I work as a machine learning (ML) engineer. I use math every day to teach machines how to do things that are easy for humans but hard for computers. If I want to thrive and excel in my work, I have to read scientific papers on ML.

Implementing the insights from these papers is applied math, following standard steps. Not easy, but doable. What's out of reach though, is how the researchers arrived at those insights. If it's written without a lot of mystery and jargon, I can follow their logic.

However, I often can't predict what's going to happen if I stack multiple insights on the same ML model. And I struggle to develop intuition and generate insights on my own. That's why I want to add theoretical math to my utility belt.

I'm learning math because I'm curious and because I'm irritated. I get upset when I don't understand things. Working with math today feels like cheating. Like I found a spellbook but don't really know magic, I'm just playing pretend.

As a machine learning engineer, to make any kind of progress in research and experimentation, I need the ability to see through the jargon and really understand it.

Why do **you** want it?

It's helpful to view it through the lens of emotions. How do you _feel_ about your math skills and knowledge? I feel frustrated. I _know_ I can wrestle with this and win. I also feel ashamed of how my understanding atrophied.

Contrast this with how you _want_ to feel about your knowledge and abilities. I want to feel confident, playful and curious again. I also want to feel proud of what I've learned and what I can do. Not because of competition with others, but because I've tackled a difficult problem and came out on top.

## Killing the Gatekeepers

To move from how I feel to how I want to feel, I need to pass through some gates. The gates are external and internal obstacles to reaching my goals. Internal ones are fear, lack of willpower and anything else that causes reluctance to even start, let alone keep going. External ones are time and access to people and resources.

Each gate has a guardian, represented by an actual person in your life, or an imaginary voice in your head. There's a scene I've witnessed in my childhood where a parent or teacher blocks a kid from learning math, and the kid internalizes this influence as something fundamentally lacking in themselves.

Imagine a kid in your class who's struggling with math. They can't solve a particular problem. Maybe they missed a key concept, or it just didn't click. Maybe they needed a different angle or a more visual explanation. Maybe the teacher is not interested or just shit at transferring knowledge.

The teacher reaches our struggling student and taps them gently on the head and says "Maybe you should stick to humanities, math doesn't seem to be your strong suit." And the kid forever internalizes "I can't do math. I'm not good enough." The external gatekeeper became an internal one.

It's enough to make my blood boil. The teacher is entrusted with this precious forming mind and they casually shut it down. If you had a teacher like that or anyone else that tried to keep math away from you, their words and voice live on in your head, stuck in a loop. They are your gatekeepers.

Maybe you don't remember the person or event but it's there as a sense of dread. Any time you try to climb the math hill and start to struggle, it activates and discourages you. It's the thorny part of your mind and you don't want to go there. You think it's your fault, but it's not.

Math is complex and takes time. No one ever allowed you to take your time and try to work through problems in as many ways you need to figure it out. You never had permission to struggle, fail and try again!

Well, you have my permission. There are no more gatekeepers. Whatever voice you have inside that's telling you that you're not smart enough or not good enough, even if it's your own, acknowledge it, accept it but _keep going_.

## Making a PACT

Once I leave the gatekeepers in the dust, it's time to set goals, right? Smart people set [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goals; everyone knows that!

But, I _suck_ at SMART goals. Outside of test-taking, math doesn't fit the framework. It's impossible to know how long it will take. What if it's not relevant to my current job, but something that I do in my spare time?

SMART goals focus on outcomes, but what I need are _outputs_.

To create a goal that relies on continuous growth rather than specific achievements, it's better to make a [PACT](https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact). **PACT** is an acronym for:

- Purposeful
- Actionable
- Continuous
- Trackable

If you're masochistic enough to want to learn theoretical math, it needs to be **purposeful**. Being a math god isn't crucial to me right this instant, but it's meaningful in the long-term. It's going to be easier to stick with because I _care_ about learning math.

**Actionable** just means something I control daily, instead of looking far into the future. If I can go through one chapter of a math book in a day, or solve a problem set, I'll go to bed feeling motivated to do the same thing tomorrow. Repeating that process **continuously** will bring me to my long-term ambition.

Measuring progress can be a double-edged sword. Stats give me the illusion of progress. So I opt for the simplicity of **tracking** progress with a "yes" or "no". Did you eat your vegetables today? Have you read any theory today? Have you solved a problem set? Put a check in a box and move on.

## The Way is Hard

Learning math will not be easy. Learning anything of substance is not easy. It can be complex, abstract and boring. But it is worthwhile.

The introduction to any book or course will likely be simple. It's designed to whet your appetite. But it will quickly progress to harder examples that you will struggle with or have to revisit, many times.

Once you hit that point, _that's_ when you're really learning. When you start to feel that stress and desire to look at your phone and scroll through social media feeds, that's when you need to double down.

Obstacles are not problems, they are here for training. You are either training yourself to run away from difficulty or to face it.

Struggling to understand is a signal that you're on the right track. Embrace it and keep going. Maybe you need to read a chapter three more times to understand or attack a problem from another angle, but _do not back down_ or succumb to distraction. Use whatever productivity trick works for you.

This feeling of discomfort during learning is a natural part of the process. Using your brain is expensive, in terms of bodily resources. Your body thinks it's better for survival to get social validation or a sugary snack, so it resists. Don't quote me on that, I'm not a fucking evolutionary biologist, but that's what it feels like. :P

Whenever I feel that discomfort, I get _excited_! Because that tells me that I've struck gold, I'm _learning_! My existing understanding is breaking down, and a stronger foundation is being built with the pieces.

This is perfectly summed up by my favorite quote from Bruce Lee:

> "To become a champion requires a condition of readiness that causes the individual to approach with pleasure even the most tedious practice session. The more “ready” the person is to respond to a stimulus, the more satisfaction he finds in the response, and the more “unready” he is, the more annoying he finds it to be forced to act."

## It's Dangerous to Go Alone

Having strong reserves of drive and discipline is important, but relying solely on your willpower is risky. What happens if you get sick or decide to go traveling? How will you get back on track? What happens if you reach a problem you cannot solve or proof that just will not surrender to you.

The biggest drawback of being a self-learner in pure math is the lack of access to professors, TAs and peers. Study groups are one of the best ways to learn. It's not just the access to solutions, but also bouncing ideas off each other that can trigger a flash of understanding.

This is why I'm here. I will be your study buddy. I will send out newsletters as I'm hiking towards the various peaks of mathematical knowledge. I'll also be holding online study groups that you can attend and nerd out with others.

## You ARE a Mathematician

In the programming world, there are assholes who constantly try to debate with other people about who qualifies to be a "real" software developer. They base their claims on weak arguments about programming languages, education, and status. They are the gatekeepers. And what do we say to gatekeepers? NOT TODAY!

If you write code, you are a developer. Equally, if you do math, you are a mathematician. Don't let anyone’s diploma, snobbery, and fancy jargon scare you away.

To borrow [a lesson from James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits), you must build a new identity for yourself, one that incorporates rocking math. And you do it by choosing who you want to be (the coolest fucking mathematician alive) and then **proving** it to yourself with small wins.

A small win can be reading a chapter of a book or solving a difficult equation. It could also be about connecting to others who are on the same journey. Set incremental goals for yourself and reach them. They will accumulate and you will look back and say "Damn, I guess I AM a mathematician!"
